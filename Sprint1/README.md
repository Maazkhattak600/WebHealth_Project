# DevOps Training - Sprint 1

# Hello Lambda Function

This is my first AWS CDK Project and deployed on AWS Cloud.

Its basically a Hello World Lambda Function.

This was a first step towards the learning of AWS Cloud.

We learned how to setup CDK on local machine. How to configure AWS on our local machine. Write a lambda Function and then deploy it on the AWS cloud.

When you type the command "cdk synth" after writing your cdk app it make a cloud formation template. After that when we deploy it using command "cdk deploy" it's deployed on the cloud and we can then test it on the AWS Console.
